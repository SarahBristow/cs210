# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
In this project, I had to create code for both C++ and Python in order to develop a produce list, find the frequency of a specific item, and create a text-based histogram for the grocery list. These options are chosen from a list for the user to select and loop.

# What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was creating a readable menu and I created a loop for the menu in C++.

#Where could you enhance your code?
I could enhance my code by showing an error for the user when putting in letters. Along with this, I could edit my text-based histogram to be more visually pleasing.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to support your network?
I found that creating the histogram was the most challenging to write. I had a couple of issues when trying to create the frequency.dat file. I was able to create the histogram by watching many YouTube videos on different ideas on how to create one. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills from this project that could transfer is how to create a histogram, being able to run C++ and Python together, and finding the text in a list.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program readable by creating spaces to help users read it easier while adding comments to ensure I know what I was doing at each part of the code. I made the program maintainable by using descriptive names in my code.
